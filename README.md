# hello-world
This is the default "Hello World" guide for Github. Being new to this platform, I try to follow as closely as possible indications.
I am supposed here to write more about myself, but this is not going to happen, I'm going to happily conclude the modification by letting this line. No need to describe myself in more terms.
